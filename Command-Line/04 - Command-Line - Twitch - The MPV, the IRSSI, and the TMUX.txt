# Twitch - The MPV, the IRSSI, and the TMUX - https://vid.me/gEdZm
##################################################################

| MPV
`----

	* mpv can be used to play anything that youtube-dl supports because it
          uses youtube-dl by default when handling URL's.

| IRSSI
`------

	* irssi is an IRC client. Twitch supports IRC for communication.

	* https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1302780-twitch-irc

		- the guide says it doesn't support SSL, but that's not true
                  anymore. Use port 6697 for encryption.

| TMUX
`-----

	* The point of using tmux for this is so we can view a live Twitch
          stream as ASCII text and chat in another pane.
		
		- tmux new-session \; set -g mouse on \; split-window -h -p 20 \; attach

			** splits the window with mouse enable for easy pane switching
                           and -p for percent so we can then run:

				1. mpv --vo=caca --ao=alsa [twitch url]

				2. irssi

	* You can run a twitch stream with mpv in GUI and then use another
          client for IRC. Or, do what I do if I don't want ASCII but in TTY, 
          change the runlevel to 3 and then have mpv in tty1 and irssi in tty2.
