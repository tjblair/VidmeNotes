| Toxic
`------

	* Command line Tox client for Linux/Unix systems

	* I could only test texting, file sending, and audio calling;
          my webcam is not setup on my Linux machine.

	* Using espeak as my audio voice worked

| qTox

	* Cross-platform GUI Tox client
	
	* Tested texting, file-sharing, audio calling with Toxic, and
          video calling with Antidote.

| Antidote

	* phone Tox client

	* Seems to support the same things as everything else

| Notes
`------

	* Not that I don't mind adding friends via Tox, it was really
          annoying to blur out so much stuff.
