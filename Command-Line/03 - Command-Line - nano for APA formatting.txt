| Nano
`-----

	* Use "nano -m -u -c r102"
		-m = mouse
		-u = undo/redo
		-c = constantly shows cursor position
		-r102 = will wordwrap at column 102
	
	* "^" means "Ctrl" on the keyboard
	
	* Normally, nano only wordwraps until the text reaches the edge of the terminal or screen.
	  However, because of inconsistent screen and terminal sizes, you may want to figure out
          how many characters you need instead. To do the math properly, 10 or 12 point font is
          characters per inch. So, a standard "8.5in. x 11in." sheet of paper would need to
          wordwrap at no more than 102 characters with no margins taken into account. You can
          change the font size in your terminal preferences.

	* Ctrl+g for a help screen and Ctrl+x to exit
	* Ctrl+w for search
	* Alt+w for repeat search
	* Alt+r for search and replace
	* Ctrl+r to place text from another file at the cursor location
	* Alt+> or Alt+< to switch between multiple instances of nano

	* Not all terminal emulators support syntax highlighting, but you can find languages nano
          supports inside /usr/share/nano/

| Spellcheck and converting
`--------------------------

	* Install a page called "spell" to have spellchecking inside of nano. If you cannot find
          it for you system, install "aspell."
