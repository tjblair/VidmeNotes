What you'll need:
1. Linux/Unix system
2. dialog
3. The script
4. ImageMagick
5. fbi (frame-buffering image-viewer)
6. xdg-open

* Make sure to "sudo chmod +x image-edit"

* If you want an unfinished and proabably broken (I don't really use it) batch editing version, you can find it here: https://github.com/TheOuterLinux/climenu/blob/master/batch-image-edit
* The image-edit script inside https://github.com/TheOuterLinux/climenu/blob/master/image-edit is not the same as the one in this directory.
