Using the "bsd-games" package, we can run a program called "primes" to 
make it much easier to check if a number is prime or to find a range 
of prime numbers.

1. The swamp monster has OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) and only 
   comes up from the swamp on days of the month that are prime 
   numbers. If it's October 7, what other days of the month will he
   come out?

2. A mummy prides himself on his expertise of mathimatics. A black cat 
comes to visit his tomb and asks if 39 is a prime number. What would 
the "expert" say?
