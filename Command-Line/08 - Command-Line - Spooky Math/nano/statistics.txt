Note: I'm going to keep this simple because you are much better off 
      using programs like GNU Octave or R for this. If you don't mind
      GUI, pspp is an excellent clone of SPSS.

1. A vampire did a survey on blood types. Out of a sample size of 20 
   not so willing participants, ignoring (+ vs. -): A, A, AB, O, O, B, B, 
   AB, A, B, A, B, AB, A, O, O, A, A, B, O, what was the most common 
   blood type of his victims?

2. Frankenstein loves Halloween. It's the only time of the year he can 
   go mushroom picking without being chased by torches. Because he comes 
   from a scientific background, he likes to measure the mass of what 
   he finds: .25g, 1g, 2g, .5g, and 1g. What's the mean, median, and 
   variance of his mushrooms?
