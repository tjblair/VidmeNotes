1. A Werewolf is looking for a cure for his lycanthropy and stumbles upon 
   an old chemistry book, "Getting Out of Hairy Situations," by Van Helsing. 
   In the book it says to mix one mole of silver (Ag) with one mole of 
   nitrogen (N), one mole of carbon (C), and one mole of oxygen (O). What 
   would the total mass be? Mixing the silver with nitric acid and ethanol 
   did not result in the type of hair removal he was hoping for.
