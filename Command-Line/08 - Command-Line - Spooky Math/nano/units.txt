1. The werewolf, having singed his hair off from the previous 
   (gperiodic) example, is not feeling so well. His physician, Dr. 
   Jekyll, prescribes him some liquid pain medicine. A single dose
   is 60mL; however, the poor werewolf only has teaspoons. How many
   teaspoons is 60mL? He's burnt pretty badly...

2. Dracula travels to London but gets off of the boat like everyone
   else. As an immigrant, he is checked out by a physician. To save
   time, the doctor asks him his weight. Dracula says "81 killograms."
   But because this is the UK in late 1800's, the doctor needs pounds. 
   How much in pounds does Dracula weigh?
