# Basic Math
1. Jane sees 4 black cats in the woods and Will sees 3 more black cats. How many black cats are there in total?

2. Jason had 10 machetes but lost 4 of them. How many machetes does Jason still have?

3. Billy, Anna, and Susan went trick or treating together and each received 30 pieces of candy. How much total candy is there between them?

	--> candy=30
	--> candy*3

4. On Halloween night, Linus and his friends Sally, Charlie, and Pig-Pen wait for the Great Pumpkin to show and give them presents.
   However, the Great Pumpkin only brought 20 presents with him. How many presents does each kid get?

	--> presents=20
        --> kids=4
        --> presents/kids

# Fractions
1. A bratty kid finds a spider and pulls off 1/4 of it's legs. How many legs does the spider have left?
	
	--> from fractions import *
	--> 8*Fraction(1,4)

2. 56 ravens are being chased by witches but only 1/8 of the ravens belong to them. How many of them are wild?

	--> from fractions import *
	--> 56*Fraction(1,8)

3. There is a party at a haunted house with 12 zombies and 15 demons. Half of the zombies and 1/3 of the demons leave before midnight. How many monsters are left?

	--> from fractions import *
	--> (12+15)-((12*Fraction(1,2))+(15*Fraction(1,3)))

# Primes (See nano folder)

	* Using "primes" from the bsd-games package.

# Statistics

Only simple examples because you are much better off using GNU Octave or R for this.

1. A vampire did a survey on blood types. Out of a sample size of 20 not so willing participants, ignoring (+ vs. -): A, A, AB, O, O, B, B, AB, A, B, A, B, AB, A,
   O, O, A, A, B, O, what was the most common blood type of his victims?

	--> from sympy import *
	--> from statistics import mode *
	--> A = Symbol('A')
	--> B = Symbol('B')
	--> AB = Symbol('AB')
	--> O = Symbol('O')
	--> bloodtype = [A,A,AB,O,O,B,B,AB,A,B,A,B,AB,A,O,O,A,A,B,O]
	--> mode(bloodtype)

2. Frankenstein loves Halloween. It's the only time of the year he can go mushroom picking without being chased by torches. Because he comes from a scientific background, he likes to measure
   the mass of what he finds: .25g, 1g, 2g, .5g, and 1g. What's the mean, median, and variance of his mushrooms?

	--> from statistics import *
	--> mushrooms=[0.25,1,2,0.5,1]
	--> mean(mushrooms)
	--> median(mushrooms) #If even numbers, use median_high() or median_low()
	--> variance(mushrooms) #Low numbers are usually good

# Functions


1. A ghoul was trotting down the sidewalk and noticed a large spiderweb. Being a math wizard as most ghouls are, noticed 4 tasty moths trapped in one quadrant, 3 juicy beetles in another
   quadrant, 2 sour spiders in another, and 1 confused worm in the last. If this ghoulish buffet had been three times better, how many of each snack would there be?

	--> from sympy import *
 	--> Matrix([[4,3],[2,1]])*3

2. As punishment for not scaring enough trick-or-treaters, Casper the ghost was told to factor this dreadful equation, 24x^2*y+34xy+12y. How could he do this with Python?

	--> from sympy import *
	--> x = Symbol('x')
	--> y = Symbol('y')
	--> factor(24*x**2*y + 34*x*y + 12*y)

3. Casper the ghost was then told to take this factored equation, 3(2x+y)(4x-3y), and expand it. How could he do this with Python?

	--> from sympy import *
	--> x = Symbol('x')
	--> y = Symbol('y')
	--> expand(3*(2*x+y)*(4*x-3*y))

4. Satan is building a fence for Hell. Hell is an infinitely (oo) large and weird place. So if a formula was to represent the amount of fencing needed, he determined it to be y=x^x.
   However, Satan has a budget and needs to show mathematically to God as to how ridiculous that is. Using Python, what can he do?

	--> from sympy import *
	--> x = Symbol('x')
	--> limit(x**x, x, oo) #The limit of x as it gets close to infinity (oo)

5. At the start of Halloween, a hungry wicked witch smells a lost child a mile away. She takes off from the ground at 100 MPH (44.704 m/s) and then lets gravity do the rest once she 
   reaches as high as she can go. If gravity is 9.8 m/s, at what point in time will she reach her maximum height?

	--> from sympy import *
	--> t = Symbol('t')
	--> height = 44.704*t - 9.8*t**2
	--> yprime = height.diff(t) #To find the derivative of 'height'
	--> solve(yprime, t)

6. Use integrate() for integrals.

	--> integrate(yprime)

# gperiod

1. A Werewolf is looking for a cure for his lycanthropy and stumbles upon an old chemistry book, "Getting Out of Hairy Situations," by Van Helsing. In the book it says to mix one mole of
   silver (Ag) with one mole of nitrogen (N), one mole of carbon (C), and one mole of oxygen (O). What would the total mass be? Mixing the silver with nitric acid and ethanol did not result 
   in the type of hair removal he was hoping for.

	--> gperiod Ag, N, C, O
	--> python ... add them up
